## FreeRTOS TCP/IP over Ethernet on XMC4500 Relax Kit for Industrial/Automotive/IoT applications

Steps used to build executable using Makefile are as follows:

>$make all / make: build project executables
>$make clean: clean the generated outputs
>$make flash: start JLinkExe to flash the hex file


#This repo focuses mainly on FreeRTOS TCP/IP Server and Client over Ethernet, CMSIS NN for Neural Networks using C/C++ for Industrial and IoT applications.

You can use it as a base for you project which uses ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller utilizing FreeRTOS, FreeRTOS-Plus with C/C++.

It is portable on other microcontrollers (CM4F only) as well with some modifications.


You can find the Wireshark capture for performance of Server and client simultaneously running on XMC4500 CM4F @120MHz.


Happy to Share and Help :-)
