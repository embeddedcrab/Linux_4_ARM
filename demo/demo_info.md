# Demo project done in linux environment for ARM Cortex M4

This demo project contains simple led blinking using Systick interrupt for every specific interval in C and C++ environment.

I have used some specific compilation flags for demo build but you can change it according to your convinience and wish.

This project has been done on Infineon Relax Kit.

Happy to Share and Help :-)
